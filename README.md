<a name="brief"></a>
## Brief 
The client ( My Step-Son ) wanted an application to help him keep track of certain premier league players and save some details that he will later on perform statistical calculations on to help him predict the player’s future performance.
He wanted the freedom to add or remove players as needed and also the freedom to edit or remove certain stats on certain dates for certain players.

### Working on the Solution: 

To workout the solution utilising the supporting tools, technologies and methodologies covered during the training in the academy, I’ve decided the following:

    * Adopt Agile methods to manage my project
    * Perform risk assessment using the outline covered during the training
    * Implement kanban method using Trello
    * Build database ERD using Draw.io
    * Create Git repository to be my VCS
    * Use MySQL server, HTML5, CSS3 , Python, Flask and a few more python modules  to build and test the application (refer to the requirements.txt for more details )
    * Host the Application ( MySQL Database Server, Linux Web Application Server and Linux server hosting the automated deployment server for continuous * * * integration ‘Jenkins’ ) on Google Cloud Platform ( free tier )
    * Test the application
    * Deploy the application

Detailed Breakdown for each point from above
